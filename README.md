# An_evolved_Fuzzy_CMeans_algorithm_for_clustering_and_identifying_cancer_cells
Skin cancer is a life-threatening disease that requires accurate and timely diagnosis for effective 
treatment. Combined imaging techniques show promise in assisting dermatologists by sorting 
skin images into clinical categories. Fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering is a popular image
sharing method, but its performance can be affected by outliers and noise in clinical data. In 
this study, we propose a new method that modifies the Fuzzy C-means clustering method to 
improve classification accuracy in skin medicine. The modified algorithm in the research will 
further helps reduce the impact of outliers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach 
by testing on skin tissue samples. Comparison analysis with the traditional Fuzzy C-means 
clustering set and other methods demonstrates the superiority of our proposed method in 
accurately identifying cancer images. Our results show that the modification of the Fuzzy C
means clustering algorithm can improve the performance of image clustering algorithms in skin 
cancer diagnosis and classification.
